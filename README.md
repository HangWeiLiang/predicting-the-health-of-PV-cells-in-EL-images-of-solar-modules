# predicting-the-health-of-PV-cells-in-EL-images-of-solar-modules
Abstract: This project mainly aims to identify whether the photovoltaic cell components of solar panels are damaged, and conducts a comparative analysis of machine models that automatically identify defects.

The dataset contains 2,624 high-resolution electroluminescence (EL) images, preprocessed using techniques such as SMOTE to address class imbalance and perform data augmentation to prevent model underfitting.

This project implements and evaluates four different models - SVM, VGG16, VIT and an innovative CNN. Experimental results show that the fine-tuned VGG16 model outperforms other models with an accuracy of 77.90% and an F1 score of 79.00% on the test set.

Future work will focus on expanding the dataset, fine-tuning model parameters, and exploring ensemble methods to further improve accuracy and generalization. Keywordsâ€”solar panels, image recognition, Vgg16, SVM, VIT, CNN
